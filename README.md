## Overview  
This project aims to build a comprehensive restaurant management system powered by artificial intelligence. It helps automate key workflows like:  
- Order taking and processing  
- Inventory tracking and replenishment prediction  
- Staff scheduling and shift optimisation  
- Customer service / interaction insights  
- Demand forecasting and cost reduction  

By integrating AI, we aim to increase accuracy, reduce manual workload, cut down on waste, and provide real-time actionable insights.

## Features  
- 📋 **Order Management** – Customers place orders; system processes them and sends them to kitchen/serving staff.  
- 📦 **Inventory Control** – Track stock levels, generate alerts when items run low.  
- 📊 **Demand Forecasting** – AI predicts demand to optimise stocking and reduce waste.  
- 👥 **Staff Scheduling** – Allocate shifts based on predicted patron load.  
- 💬 **Customer Service Analytics** – Analyse customer behaviour and feedback to improve service.  
- 📈 **Real-Time Dashboard** – View KPIs such as orders per hour, inventory turnover, staffing efficiency.

## Architecture & Technology Stack
